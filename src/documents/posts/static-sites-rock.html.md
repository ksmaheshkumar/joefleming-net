I finally turned this site into a static site using [Docpad](http://docpad.org/) recently, and I'm super happy with that choice.

...

Why static sites? Well, for most sites, generating content on fly, as users request it, is overkill. Unless you're a content company pushing updates all day long, it makes a lot more sense to simply generate a static version of the site once, as you add new content, and just host that new version. For me, there are three main benefits to using static sites.

## Speed

WAY faster

## Cost

WAY cheaper, and WAY easier to scale

## Security

Baked in, no code, nothing to exploit
